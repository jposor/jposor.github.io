# Inferring Causality in Actions of Cooperative Agent

Comparisons of different algorithmic approaches to multi-agent systems often use reward metrics to quantify performances. For cooperative tasks, an algorithm is said to learn cooperative behavior if it achieves high rewards pursuing these tasks. The quantification of the influence of individual agents' actions on the actions of other agents of a team is rarely used as a metric. However, many algorithmic approaches to cooperative tasks use the mutual conditioning of individual actions on the actions of other agents in a team. Therefore we propose an approach to inferring causality in agents' actions and evaluate it in various games using an independent learner and a joint action learner. The games are designed to require cooperation at different levels, while the strength of the compared algorithms is either cooperation or independence.
